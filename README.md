    FOR LEGAL REASONS I am required (probably not, it just adds some spice) to inform you that:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Any misuse of either npxrc/ehourwinapp or npxrc/ehourwpf application(s) or package(s) is the Consumer/Consumers fault, and is not the responsibility of the Creator, npxrc.</li>
    </ul>

<hr>

I'll make a README another time. But for the moment, this project is on pause as I complete [the actually good looking app at npxrc/ehourwpf](https://github.com/npxrc/ehourwpf). I'll come back some other time and finish this.

This is just a bug fix release (probably, don't know what i even changed).
